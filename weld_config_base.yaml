# YOLOv11 Configuration for WeldSight Project

# NOTE: This is a BASE configuration. The 'path' will be dynamically updated 
# by the training script for each fold (e.g., path: ../data/folds/fold_0)

# Number of classes (nc) and class names (names) based on the LoHi-WELD dataset
nc: 4
names: ['Pores', 'Deposits', 'Discontinuities', 'Stains']

# Placeholder paths (will be set relative to the final fold directory)
path: ../data/folds/fold_0 
train: images/train 
val: images/val
